## Project Description

Our project based on the Spoken Language Recognition using X-vectors paper:

Paper: [2018 odyssey X vector lid](https://danielpovey.com/files/2018_odyssey_xvector_lid.pdf)

Source repo : [X vector repository](https://github.com/KrishnaDN/x-vector-pytorch)



## Features

* Language recognition using X-vectors: The project implements the X-vector methodology described in the paper for identifying spoken languages.
* Deep neural network (DNN) embeddings: X-vectors are DNN-based embeddings that capture speaker and language characteristics.
* PyTorch implementation: The project utilizes PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, for efficient implementation and training of the X-vector model.
